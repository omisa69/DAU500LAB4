This assignment investigates the implementation and evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced deep learning techniques for image classification tasks. Fundamental operations, such as convolution and pooling, were demonstrated to extract and retain key features from images effectively. The CNN model achieved a test accuracy of 90% on the MNIST Fashion dataset, outperforming the Fully Connected Network (FCN) with 87% accuracy, highlighting the superiority of CNNs in capturing spatial hierarchies. ResNet-34 was implemented to demonstrate the utility of residual connections in enabling deeper networks and addressing the vanishing gradient problem, achieving a test accuracy of 88%. Transfer learning with the pre-trained Xception model achieved the highest test accuracy of 93.06% on the tf flowers dataset, showcasing the efficiency of leveraging pre-trained weights for domain-specific tasks. The results emphasize the importance of architecture selection and techniques like transfer learning for improving performance and enabling effective feature learning. Future work could explore fine-tuning pre-trained models and advanced augmentation methods to tackle more complex datasets. This study provides insights into practical applications of deep learning for image classification.
